Time to be cautious? A quick look at valuations and the term structure of volatility.
<!--more-->

<br>

Looking at the long-term chart of the S&P500, the coronavirus sell-off now looks like a blip in the U.S. bull market stretching back to 2009. Historically speaking, markets have an upward bias, but seldom in straight lines and with such speed we have witnessed recently. Central bank policy is certainly part of this story and the valuations we now have. Where else is the money to go?

Looking back at just after the worst had passed in 2009, investors were paying roughly $15 for every $1 of earnings, a 15x multiple. Looking at valuations now, the market is basically demanding closer to $31. It was actually closer to $40 a short while ago. The historical average is about 16x for perspective.

When I said, "Where is the money to go?", we can see that a lot of it went into the equity market as roughly two-thirds of returns have been due to multiple expansion, and the rest earnings growth. This tempo of market gains and multiple expansion is highly unlikely to last based on the current market cycle and outlook.

As the indices were creeping to new all-time highs, I have been looking at the volatility skew and term structure. Typically, S&P500 has a negative skew due to imbalances of call vs put buying and the nature of corrections, which tend to be more volatile than when markets rise. Looking at the skew over the past month, puts have become even more expensive. Are institutions starting to hedge? The overall market structure is also very shaky from a market profile perspective (see Jim Dalton).

If you feel even a little bit nervous about where we are, a put spread might be a great way to to protect some of the downside cheaply due to the skew, or just speculate with the potential for a nice payoff. Keep in mind that markets rarely sell off due to valuations, but start with a catalyst. Could new lockdowns and Coronavirus variants be the catalyst? Or perhaps China's corporate bond defaults hitting a record high this year? It's time to be cautious.
